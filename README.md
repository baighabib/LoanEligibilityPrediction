# Classification-LoanEligibilityPrediction

•	Explored factors influencing loan approval and developed a predictive model using historical customer data and conducted hyperparameter tuning using grid search and random search methods to optimize and adjust model performance.

•	Directed comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and variable relationships, and applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance. 

•	Evaluated Logistic Regression and Decision Trees models based on accuracy, precision, feature importance and relevance to actual bank procedures for home loan approval. 

•	Achieved 86% accuracy for predicting loan eligibility using Logistic Regression and 79% using Decision Trees, with Precision of around 85% precision for classifying eligible customers for both models.
